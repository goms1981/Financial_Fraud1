    "## 1. Which insights did you gain from your EDA? \n",
    "### Datas should be downsized in order to run smoothly. It could be seen with the isFraud hue that the only fraudulent cases are within the types 'TRANSFER' and 'CASH-OUT'.There were no null values to be seen within this dataset.According to correlation matrix oldbalanceDest and newbalanceDest have a very strong correlation. Amount is moderately correlated with both oldbalanceDest and newbalanceDest. isFraud has low correlations with most other features, pointing  that fraudulent activity may not be directly linked to simple numerical values like transaction amount or balances. It's depend more on Transaction type.\n",
